# Anime Recommendation System using NLP

### Description:
This repository hosts an Anime Recommendation System leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to offer personalized anime suggestions based on user preferences and anime descriptions. By analyzing textual data and user interactions, the recommendation system aims to enhance the anime viewing experience for users.

### Key Details:
- **Dataset:** The dataset utilized in this project comprises anime metadata and user interaction data, including ratings, reviews, and watch history.
- **Tasks:** The project involves various tasks such as data preprocessing, text analysis, and recommendation system implementation.
- **Techniques Used:** NLP techniques are applied for text processing and feature extraction, including tokenization, vectorization using techniques like Count Vectorizer, and similarity measurement using Cosine Similarity.

### Project Overview:
The project workflow begins with comprehensive data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Anime descriptions are then subjected to NLP analysis to extract meaningful features that capture the essence of each anime. Through the use of Count Vectorizer, textual descriptions are transformed into numerical vectors, enabling efficient comparison and similarity calculation using Cosine Similarity. The recommendation system utilizes these vectors to suggest anime titles that closely match the user's preferences, thereby facilitating personalized recommendations.

### Repository Contents:
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing, NLP analysis, and recommendation system implementation. It includes detailed explanations and comments to guide users through the process.
- **Dataset File:** The dataset used for the project is included in the repository or can be downloaded from an external source.
